# Artwork Buying System Implementation

This implementation adds a complete buying system to the Folkify platform, allowing users to purchase artworks from artists with proper authentication and order management.

## Features Implemented

### 1. User Authentication Integration
- ✅ Users must be logged in to purchase artworks
- ✅ Purchase buttons only show for authenticated users
- ✅ Login prompts for unauthenticated users
- ✅ User data pre-filled in purchase forms

### 2. Purchase Flow
- ✅ **Purchase Modal**: Complete purchase form with buyer details
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Required fields for phone and address
- ✅ **User Data Pre-fill**: Automatic population of name and email
- ✅ **Purchase Confirmation**: Success feedback after purchase

### 3. Data Management
- ✅ **Firestore Integration**: Purchases stored in `purchases` collection
- ✅ **Purchase Service**: Complete CRUD operations for purchases
- ✅ **User Purchase History**: View all user purchases
- ✅ **Artist Sales Dashboard**: Manage incoming orders

### 4. Status Management
- ✅ **Order Statuses**: pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered, cancelled
- ✅ **Payment Statuses**: pending, paid, refunded
- ✅ **Status Updates**: Artists can update order and payment status
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: UI updates reflect status changes

  artworkId: string,          // Reference to artwork
  artworkTitle: string,       // Artwork title
  artworkPrice: number,       // Purchase price
  artworkCurrency: string,    // Currency (default: INR)
  artistId: string,           // Artist user ID
  buyerId: string,            // Buyer user ID
  buyerName: string,          // Buyer display name
  buyerEmail: string,         // Buyer email
  buyerPhone: string,         // Buyer contact number
  buyerAddress: string,       // Shipping address
  status: string,             // Order status
  paymentStatus: string,      // Payment status
  createdAt: string,          // ISO timestamp
  updatedAt: string,          // ISO timestamp

}
```

## How to Demo

### For Buyers:
1. **Log in** to your account
2. **Browse artworks** in the gallery
3. **Click on an artwork** that's marked "For Sale"
4. **Click "Buy Artwork"** button
5. **Fill in the purchase form** with phone and address
6. **Submit the purchase** - you'll see a success message
7. **View purchase history** in your dashboard

### For Artists:
1. **Log in** to your artist account
2. **Go to Dashboard** → **Sales tab**
3. **View incoming purchases** with buyer details
4. **Update order status** (confirm, ship, deliver)
5. **Mark payments as received**
6. **Track revenue** and sales statistics

## API Usage

### Create a Purchase
```javascript
import { createPurchase } from '../services/purchaseService';

const result = await createPurchase(artworkId, buyerData, artworkData);
if (result.success) {
  console.log('Purchase created:', result.purchaseId);
}
```

### Get User Purchases
```javascript
import { getUserPurchases } from '../services/purchaseService';

const result = await getUserPurchases(userId);
if (result.success) {
  console.log('User purchases:', result.purchases);
}
```

### Update Purchase Status
```javascript
import { updatePurchaseStatus } from '../services/purchaseService';

const result = await updatePurchaseStatus(purchaseId, 'shipped', 'paid');
```

## Security Considerations

- ✅ **Authentication Required**: Only logged-in users can make purchases
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Form inputs are validated
- ✅ **Firestore Rules**: Should be configured to restrict access
- ✅ **User Association**: Purchases linked to authenticated user accounts

## Future Enhancements

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Create test users** (buyer and artist accounts)
2. **Add artworks** with `isForSale: true` and prices
3. **Test purchase flow** end-to-end
